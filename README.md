# About
Our brains are great at creating information, storing however; not so great. With all of the things that we must remember on a daily basis combined with the increasingly stringent password requirements,  I was able to create a password generator that generates a password based on user specifications to make remembering passwords one less thing to worry about.


This Password Generator runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript alrts and truth statements.

Coming back to this app I have since added some effects to the background, and given the text this retro led effect. The more and more I saw it, the more it gave me Matrix vibes, so I think I will eventually take it in that direction visually.

## Access

Users will access the page through either the direct link to the deployed application

```bash
https://andrediop.github.io/Password-Generator/
```

or through the Github repository


1. Users will navigate to the github Repository to clone the repository.
```bash
https://github.com/AndreDiop/Password-Generator
```
2. To clone and run this application, you will need Git. Inside of your command line editor do the following:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreDiop/Passeword-Generator.git

npm install
```
3.Start the server instance on your local machine
 ```bash

npm start
```





## Usage

This password generator should **NOT** be used for anything where security is needed. This is just to demonstrate the ability to manipulate user input using Javascript.

After clicking the generate password button, users are prompted for how many characters they need. 

Then the user is asked whether or not they require upper case characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters. 

When users decline to modify their passwords, they are alerted that this makes their password less secure.

## Screenshots

These screen shots show the password prompts and the displayed password in the *password generator* field

```bash
Users are prompted to click the lock to begin
```

```bash
Users are presented with a password to use after clicking generate and answering the alert prompts

```




## Contributing

This app couldn't have been built with out fellow students, instructors, tutors, and TA's of the GT coding bootcamp.

I'm not taking requests at this time however, please reach out to me if you see ways that I can improve upon my code.


## Future Development

Moving forward with this app I would like to reduce the amount of code used to make this app work.

Using regex to represent large data sets of numbers with less redundancy.

I would like to remove alerts from the functioning of the app and use something less intrusive or just having checkboxes of what the password requirements are.

Add a paralax element to the background.

Consider using an 8 bit theme and going with a completely vibe that way.
