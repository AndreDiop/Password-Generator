# About

Utilizing knowledge of Javascript, for loops, truth statements and methods, I was able to create a password generator that generates a password based on user specifications.

## Access

Users will access the page through either the direct link to the deployed application

```bash
https://andrediop.github.io/password-generator/
```

or through the Github repository

```bash
https://github.com/AndreDiop/password-generator
```

## Usage

This password generator should **NOT** be used for anything were security is needed. This is just to demonstrate the ability to manipulate user input using Javascript.

After clicking the generate password button, users are prompted for how many characters they need. 

Then the user is asked whether or not they require upper and lower case characters, 

## Screenshots

These screen shots show the password prompts and the displayed password in the *password generator* field

```bash
Users are prompted to enter how many characters between 8 - 128 they need
```
