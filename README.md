# About
This project is a password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create secure passwords based on criteria. Users choose the types of characters to include in the password as well as the length of the password-based on inputs by prompts. The code will check for a valid length (between 8 and 128 characters) and will validate that at least one character type has been chosen. Random characters will be chosen and the generated password will be displayed on the page.


This Password Generator runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript alerts and truth statements.




## Access

Users will access the page through either the direct link to the deployed application

```bash
https://andrediop.github.io/Password-Generator/
```

or through the Github repository


1. Users will navigate to the Github Repository to clone the repository.
```bash
https://github.com/AndreDiop/Password-Generator
```
2. To clone and run this application, you will need Git. Inside of your command line editor do the following:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreDiop/Passeword-Generator.git

npm install
```
3.Start the server instance on your local machine
 ```bash

npm start
```





## Usage

This password generator should **NOT** be used for anything where security is needed. This is just to demonstrate the ability to manipulate user input using Javascript.

After clicking the generate password button, users are prompted for how many characters they need. 

Then the user is asked whether or not they require upper case characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters. 

When users decline to modify their passwords, they are alerted that this makes their password less secure.

## Screenshots

## Contributing

This app couldn't have been built without fellow students, instructors, tutors, and TA's of the GT coding Bootcamp.

I'm not taking requests at this time however, please reach out to me if you see ways that I can improve upon my code.


## Future Development

Moving forward with this app I would like to reduce the amount of code used to make this app work.



Using regex to represent large data sets of numbers with less redundancy.

I would like to remove alerts from the functioning of the app and use something less intrusive or just having checkboxes of what the password requirements are.

Add a parallax element to the background.

Consider using an 8-bit theme

Coming back to this app I have since added some effects to the background, and given the text, this retro-led effect. The more and more I saw it, the more it gave me Matrix vibes, so I think I will eventually take it in that direction visually.
